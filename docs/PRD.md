## Product Requirements Document: project-create-a-comprehensive - Healthcare Patient Portal

**1. Title:**  SecurePatient: A HIPAA-Compliant Healthcare Patient Portal

**2. Overview:**

SecurePatient is a comprehensive, HIPAA-compliant patient portal designed to improve communication and access to healthcare information.  It empowers patients with self-service capabilities, streamlines workflows for healthcare providers, and enhances the overall patient experience.  The application's value proposition lies in its secure, integrated platform offering comprehensive features, resulting in increased patient engagement, reduced administrative burden, and improved healthcare outcomes.

**3. Functional Requirements:**

* **Patient Registration & Authentication:** Secure user registration with multi-factor authentication (MFA), adhering to HIPAA guidelines for data protection.  Integration with existing healthcare provider systems (if applicable) for user data import.
* **Secure Messaging:** HIPAA-compliant, encrypted messaging system between patients and healthcare providers.  Message threading, read receipts, and notification management.
* **Appointment Scheduling:**  Online appointment scheduling with calendar integration (Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar).  Automated appointment reminders via SMS and email.  Ability to manage appointments (reschedule, cancel).
* **Medical Records Access:** Secure access to medical records, including lab results, imaging reports, and uploaded documents.  Ability for patients to upload documents.  Version control for documents.
* **Prescription Management:** View prescription details, refill requests, and medication history.  Integration with pharmacy systems (if applicable).
* **Telemedicine Integration:** Seamless integration with a telemedicine platform for video consultations.  Support for various video conferencing technologies.
* **Billing & Insurance Claims Tracking:**  View billing statements, insurance claim status, and payment history.  Integration with billing and insurance systems (if applicable).
* **Patient Profile Management:**  Ability to update personal information, contact details, emergency contacts, and insurance information.


**User Workflows:**

* **Patient Workflow:** Registration, login, messaging, appointment scheduling, medical record access, prescription management, billing review, profile update.
* **Provider Workflow:** Access patient messages, manage appointments, view medical records, access billing information.

**Data Management:**  All patient data must be stored securely and encrypted, adhering to HIPAA regulations.  Data backups and disaster recovery plans are required.

**Integration Requirements:**  Integration with existing EHR/EMR systems, pharmacy systems, billing systems, insurance providers, and telemedicine platforms will be considered based on client requirements.  APIs for each integration must be defined.

**4. Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **Performance:**  The application must be responsive and handle concurrent users efficiently.  Load testing will be conducted to ensure scalability.  Target response time: < 2 seconds for most operations.
* **Security:**  HIPAA compliance is mandatory.  Data encryption at rest and in transit, secure authentication mechanisms (MFA), regular security audits, and penetration testing are required.
* **Scalability:**  The application must be scalable to accommodate a growing number of users and data volume.  Cloud-based infrastructure is preferred.
* **Usability:**  The application must be intuitive and easy to use for both patients and healthcare providers.  User interface (UI) design will follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG).


**5. Technical Requirements:**

* **Technology Stack:** FastAPI (backend), React (frontend), PostgreSQL (database).  Consideration for containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes).
* **API Specifications:**  RESTful APIs using OpenAPI specification (Swagger).  Detailed API documentation will be provided.
* **Database Schema:**  A detailed database schema will be designed, considering data normalization and security.  HIPAA compliant data storage and encryption will be implemented.
* **Third-Party Integrations:**  APIs and SDKs for integration with EHR/EMR, pharmacy, billing, insurance, and telemedicine systems will be identified and evaluated.


**6. Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Each feature:**  Defined acceptance criteria will be documented for each feature, including functional and non-functional requirements.  Unit and integration tests will be written to verify functionality.
* **Success Metrics & KPIs:**  Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as user registration rate, active user count, message volume, appointment scheduling rate, and patient satisfaction scores will be tracked.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  UAT will be conducted with representative users to ensure the application meets their needs and expectations.


**7. Release Criteria:**

* **MVP:**  The MVP will include patient registration, secure messaging, appointment scheduling, and basic medical record access.
* **Launch Readiness Checklist:**  A comprehensive checklist will be used to ensure the application is ready for launch, including performance testing, security audits, and user documentation.
* **Post-Launch Monitoring:**  Continuous monitoring of system performance, security, and user feedback will be implemented.  Regular updates and bug fixes will be released.


**8. Assumptions and Dependencies:**

* **Technical Assumptions:**  Availability of reliable cloud infrastructure, successful integration with third-party systems.
* **Business Assumptions:**  Sufficient funding, market demand for the application, regulatory compliance.
* **External Dependencies:**  Third-party API providers, telemedicine platforms, payment gateways.


**9. Risks and Mitigation:**

* **Technical Risks:**  Integration challenges with third-party systems, security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks.  Mitigation:  Thorough integration testing, regular security audits, performance monitoring, and contingency plans.
* **Business Risks:**  Market competition, regulatory changes, low user adoption.  Mitigation:  Competitive analysis, proactive regulatory compliance, marketing and user engagement strategies.


**10. Next Steps:**

* **Development Phases:**  Requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance.  Agile methodology will be used.
* **Timeline Considerations:**  A detailed project timeline will be developed, outlining key milestones and deadlines.
* **Resource Requirements:**  A detailed resource plan outlining the required personnel, tools, and infrastructure will be created.


**11. Conclusion:**
