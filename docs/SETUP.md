# Developer Setup Guide - project-create-a-comprehensive

This guide outlines the setup process for developers working on "project-create-a-comprehensive," a HIPAA-compliant healthcare patient portal.  We strongly recommend using Docker for local development.

## Prerequisites

* **Required Software Versions:**
    * Docker Desktop (>= 20.10.0) -  [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/)
    * Node.js (>= 16.0.0) - [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
    * Python (>= 3.9) - [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)
    * PostgreSQL (>= 13) - [https://www.postgresql.org/](https://www.postgresql.org/) (or your preferred database if supported)
    * Git - [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)


* **Development Tools:**
    * Text editor or IDE (see recommendations below)
    * A terminal or command prompt


* **IDE Recommendations and Configurations:**
    * **VS Code:** Highly recommended due to its extensibility and excellent support for JavaScript, Python, and Docker. Install extensions for Python, JavaScript, and Docker.
    * **PyCharm:**  A powerful IDE specifically for Python development.  Good for backend work.
    * **WebStorm:** A robust IDE for JavaScript development. Good for frontend work.


## Local Development Setup

### Option 1: Docker Development (Recommended)

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Docker Setup Commands:** Ensure Docker Desktop is running.

3. **Development `docker-compose.yml` Configuration:**  This file (located in the project root) should define the services (database, backend, frontend).  Example:

   ```yaml
   version: "3.9"
   services:
     db:
       image: postgres:13
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=your_db_user
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_db_password
         - POSTGRES_DB=your_db_name
       ports:
         - "5432:5432"
     backend:
       build: ./backend
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       depends_on:
         - db
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_db_user:your_db_password@db:5432/your_db_name
     frontend:
       build: ./frontend
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       depends_on:
         - backend
   ```

4. **Hot Reload Setup:**  Your frontend build process (e.g., using webpack or similar) should be configured for hot reloading. This will automatically update the browser when you make code changes.  Refer to your frontend framework's documentation.


### Option 2: Native Development

**This option is significantly more complex and requires more manual configuration, prone to environment inconsistencies. Docker is strongly recommended.**

1. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Database Setup:**  Install PostgreSQL locally. Configure the database according to your chosen database management tool (e.g., pgAdmin).


## Environment Configuration

* **Required Environment Variables:**  These will be defined in a `.env` file (example shown below).  They should include database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information.  **Never commit `.env` files to version control.**

* **Local Development `.env` File Setup:** Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following (replace placeholders with your actual values):

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_db_user:your_db_password@localhost:5432/your_db_name
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   # ... other environment variables ...
   ```

* **Configuration for Different Environments:** Use a system like environment variables or configuration files (e.g., YAML) to manage settings for development, staging, and production environments.


## Running the Application

* **Start Commands for Development:**
    * **Docker:** `docker-compose up -d`
    * **Native:**  Start the backend server (`python manage.py runserver` or equivalent) and the frontend development server (`npm start`).


* **How to Access Frontend and Backend:** The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in `docker-compose.yml` or your frontend config) and the backend API at `http://localhost:8000` (or the port specified in `docker-compose.yml` or your backend config).

* **API Documentation Access:**  Use tools like Swagger or similar to generate and view API documentation.


## Development Workflow

* **Git Workflow and Branching Strategy:** Use Gitflow or a similar branching strategy (e.g., feature branches, pull requests).

* **Code Formatting and Linting Setup:** Use tools like `black` (Python), `prettier` (JavaScript), and `eslint` (JavaScript) to enforce consistent code style.

* **Testing Procedures:** Implement unit and integration tests using appropriate frameworks (e.g., `pytest` for Python, `Jest` for JavaScript).

* **Debugging Setup:** Use your IDE's debugger or command-line tools.


## Database Management

* **Running Migrations:** Use database migration tools (e.g., Alembic for Python, Sequelize migrations for Node.js) to manage database schema changes.

* **Seeding Development Data:** Create scripts to populate the database with sample data for testing and development.

* **Database Reset Procedures:**  Implement scripts to easily reset the database to a clean state.


## Testing

* **Running Unit Tests:** `pytest` (Python), `jest` (JavaScript).

* **Running Integration Tests:**  Use tools that allow you to test the interaction between different components (e.g., backend and database).

* **Test Coverage Reports:** Generate coverage reports to track the percentage of code covered by tests.


## Common Development Tasks

* **Adding New API Endpoints:** Follow the API design guidelines and ensure proper authentication and authorization.

* **Adding New Frontend Components:**  Use your frontend framework's component architecture.

* **Database Schema Changes:** Use database migrations to manage changes to the database schema.

* **Adding Dependencies:** Use `pip` (Python) or `npm` (JavaScript) to add new dependencies.


## Troubleshooting

* **Common Setup Issues:** Refer to the specific error messages and consult the documentation for the relevant tools and technologies.

* **Port Conflicts Resolution:** Change the ports used by your applications or stop conflicting processes.

* **Dependency Issues:** Carefully check your `requirements.txt` (Python) or `package.json` (JavaScript) files and resolve any version conflicts.

* **Environment Variable Problems:** Double-check your `.env` file and ensure that the environment variables are correctly set.


## Contributing

* **Code Style Guidelines:** Adhere to the established code style guidelines (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Airbnb style guide for JavaScript).

* **Pull Request Process:** Create clear and concise pull requests with detailed descriptions of the changes.

* **Issue Reporting:**  Provide clear and reproducible steps to reproduce any issues.


This guide provides a solid foundation for developers working on this project. Remember to consult the documentation for specific tools and technologies as needed.  Remember to prioritize HIPAA compliance throughout the development process.
